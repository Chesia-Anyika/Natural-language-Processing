        "#### Explanation of output\n",
        "\n",
        "The output presents the results of parsing five test sentences using both the CKY and Earley algorithms, alongside the time taken for each parsing attempt. In each case, both algorithms returned an \"Invalid\" result, indicating that the sentences could not be successfully parsed according to the defined grammar.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first sentence, \"the cat chased the mouse,\" was tested with both algorithms and returned invalid results. This outcome suggests that the grammar defined does not support the structure of this sentence, likely due to the absence of a verb phrase (VP) that can accommodate the actions and subjects present. The time taken for CKY was notably faster than Earley's, reflecting CKY's efficiency in parsing when the input aligns more closely with its capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second sentence, \"the dog barked in the park,\" also resulted in an invalid parse. Again, this indicates that the grammar may not include rules that accommodate the subject-verb-object structure inherent in this sentence. The timing shows that both algorithms performed similarly, with CKY remaining marginally faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third sentence, \"the cat saw a dog in the garden,\" faced the same fate, yielding invalid results. The repeated invalidity across these test sentences highlights the limitations of the current grammar. In addition, the performance times indicate that Earley is generally consistent but shows some variability depending on the sentence structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fourth sentence, \"the man chased the mouse with the dog,\" resulted in an invalid parse as well, reinforcing the idea that the grammar lacks flexibility to capture various sentence constructions. The time taken by CKY remained slightly lower, showcasing its efficiency in processing simpler structures, while Earley took a bit longer, potentially due to its more complex state management.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the sentence \"a mouse chased a cat in the garden\" also resulted in invalid parsing. Interestingly, in this case, Earley performed faster than CKY, highlighting how the parsing efficiency can vary with different sentence structures despite both algorithms ultimately failing to provide a valid parse.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the output demonstrates that both the CKY and Earley algorithms struggle with the defined grammar when faced with these test sentences. The consistent \"Invalid\" results across all sentences point to the need for refining the grammar to better accommodate various sentence constructions. Furthermore, the performance times suggest that while CKY generally offers quicker parsing, the relative efficiency of Earley can vary depending on the complexity of the input. This reinforces the importance of understanding both algorithms' strengths and limitations when selecting an appropriate parsing strategy.\n",

        "\n",
        "**CKY Algorithm**\n",
        "\n",
        "The CKY (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm is designed to parse context-free grammars that are in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). One significant limitation of the CKY algorithm is that it can only work with grammars that conform to this specific format. This requirement can complicate parsing for grammars that are not already in CNF, necessitating a conversion process that can introduce complexity and potential ambiguities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity of the CKY algorithm is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the length of the input sentence. This cubic time complexity can be a drawback for very long sentences, as the parsing time increases rapidly with the input size. Despite this, CKY is particularly efficient when dealing with unambiguous grammars, where a single parse tree exists. However, the algorithm may struggle with ambiguous grammars, leading to multiple parse trees or a more significant computational burden due to increased state management.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Earley Algorithm**\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, the Earley algorithm is capable of handling all context-free grammars, including those that are ambiguous. This flexibility makes it a more versatile choice when working with diverse grammatical structures. Like CKY, the Earley algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^3)$. However, it can perform more efficiently in many cases, particularly when the grammar allows for early termination of parsing or when the input sentence is relatively straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its advantages, the Earley algorithm can consume more memory compared to CKY due to the number of parsing states it generates. Each state represents a potential position in the parsing process, which can lead to a larger memory footprint, especially for complex sentences with multiple potential parses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Preferences**\n",
        "\n",
        "When deciding between the CKY and Earley algorithms, it is important to consider the specific characteristics of the grammar and the input. The CKY algorithm is preferable when the grammar is already in CNF and efficient parsing is desired. Its structured approach allows for faster parsing in these scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversely, the Earley algorithm is the better choice when dealing with complex or ambiguous grammars, particularly when converting the grammar to CNF is not feasible or practical. Its ability to handle a broader range of grammatical structures makes it suitable for many real-world applications, where ambiguity and complexity are often present.\n"
