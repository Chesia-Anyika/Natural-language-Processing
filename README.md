# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Course Repository

This repository contains assignments, quizzes, and exams for my **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course.

## About Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the use of computational techniques to analyze and model human language. This course covers various NLP techniques for understanding, processing, and generating text, enabling machines to interact with human language in meaningful ways. Key topics in this course include:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to clean and structure text.
- **Language Models**: Statistical and deep learning models for text understanding, including n-grams, RNNs, and transformers.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting sentiment from text to understand opinions and emotions.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and categorizing entities like names, locations, and organizations.
- **Applications**: Real-world uses of NLP in chatbots, machine translation, and text classification.

## Repository Contents  
- **Assignments**: Hands-on exercises applying NLP techniques to real-world text data.
- **Quizzes**: Assessments of theoretical knowledge and practical skills in NLP.
- **Exams**: Comprehensive evaluations of NLP concepts and their application in language processing.

This repository showcases my work in mastering NLP techniques and their application in real-world text data analysis.
